config:

    parsing:
    - test missing location, target_root
    - test missing sources
    - test machine excludes
    - test excludes properly added between machine and a source
    - test filenames are built properly when missing or have extra slashes
    - test that location "local" works and resolves properly
    - test that non-local machines make it through parsing and work properly
        - maybe ssh over some files, then try to rsync them?

run:
    - what happens when there is an error message from rsync?
